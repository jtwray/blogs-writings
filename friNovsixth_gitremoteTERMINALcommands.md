Ever wondered if you were Pushing to the correct remote Repo?
Did I fork?

A better way than just crossing fingers and tapping enter exists my friend.

Git Bash has an excellent help system ready to go at our fingertips that I have only recently(today) discovered.

By using 'git help' + < 'remote' > or < 'init' >
         any git command can be further explained with a new browser window.

 for example: < git help remote > will open a page with descriptions and examples

 this is the file that opens on my local machine-->file:///C:/Program%20Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git-remote.html

yours may be slightly different depending on where you installed git in your system.
'''bash
hp@tux MINGW64 ~/Downloads/LambdaSchool/BUILD/kids-fly/serverless/KidsFly (usePositionHook)
$ git help
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
